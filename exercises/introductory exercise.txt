
Validation feature on sign-in page on snapchat mobile app (form processing)
User input/information needed: username or email address and password
When one field is incorrect, the app provides feedback saying that the information entered is invalid or incorrect (validation).
<Form action = “ofhaof.php” method=”post”>
Username or email address: <input type=”text”>
Password: <input type=”text”>
<input type = “submit”>
</form>
//needs to check user input against database of usernames and passwords
//if user input is valid, logs user into app, if user input is invalid then it doesn’t allow the user to log in sending an error message
